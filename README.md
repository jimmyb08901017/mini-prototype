# mini-prototypes

Everytime you start a project or want to create some new functions in a project, the better way to do it is to first write a prototype for it. After running prototypes without problems, you may transplant the code into the project you are working on. This is a good practice I think. So here I put all the prototypes that is done(or undone).

ðŸ‘‹ If one of the prototype here has provided some help for you, please let me know! This really motivates me to keep updating this repository. Thanks!
